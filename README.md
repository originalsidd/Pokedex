# Pokedex
Pokedex was my first dive into the world of machine learning in November 2020.

### Background
I stumbled upon Classification method in Supervised Learning and decided to make a fun Pokemon detecting model.

### Working
Using Convolution Neural Network Theory and Keras, i was able to code out a model in python which in trained by a dataset consisting of 3 popular pokemons- Pikachu, Charmander and Balbasaur.
So now, the code is able to detect the pokemon present in the user entered image (must be any 3 of the pokemons mentioned) and displays the name of the detected pokemon.

This code is only set and trained for 3 pokemons but can be extended in future.
